I'm a Ph.D. student in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Washington in Seattle, WA. My research focuses on the rise/settling velocity of particles in wavy and turbulent flows. Prior to my Ph.D., I received a Master's degree in Civil Engineering from The University of Texas at Austin and a Bachelor's degree from Universidad Autónoma Gabriel René Moreno in Bolivia. Beyond academia, I enjoy photography and drawing.
